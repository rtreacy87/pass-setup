# Introduction to Pass Password Management

## What is Pass?

Pass (also known as "the standard Unix password manager") is a simple, command-line based password management tool that follows the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well. It stores passwords in encrypted files organized in a directory structure, using GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) for encryption and Git for version control.

## Why Use Pass?

Pass offers several advantages over other password managers:

1. **Security**: Your passwords are encrypted using GPG, a well-established and trusted encryption tool
2. **Simplicity**: Pass uses a straightforward file structure and simple commands
3. **Transparency**: Being open-source, you can verify how your passwords are handled
4. **Flexibility**: Works across multiple platforms and integrates with existing tools
5. **Control**: You maintain complete control over your password data
6. **Portability**: Easy to move between systems and backup
7. **Extensibility**: Supports plugins and extensions for additional functionality

## Cross-Platform Password Management

In today's world, most of us use multiple devices - perhaps a Mac for work, a Windows PC at home, and mobile devices. Having access to your passwords across all these platforms is essential.

This wiki series will guide you through setting up Pass to work seamlessly between:
- macOS (primary system for key generation)
- Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) running Ubuntu

The same principles can later be extended to other systems like:
- Linux desktops
- Android devices (using Password Store app)
- iOS devices (using Pass for iOS)

## Implementation Approach

Our approach follows these key steps:

1. Set up GPG and Pass on macOS
2. Generate secure encryption keys
3. Configure Git for synchronization
4. Export keys securely
5. Set up WSL Ubuntu on Windows
6. Import keys to the Windows system
7. Configure Pass on Windows
8. Establish a synchronization workflow

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you'll need:

- A Mac running macOS (any recent version)
- A Windows 10/11 PC with WSL enabled
- Basic familiarity with using the terminal/command line
- Internet connection for downloading software
- Optional: A GitHub account (or other Git hosting service) for remote synchronization

Don't worry if you're not familiar with all the tools mentioned - we'll explain each step in detail.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this wiki series, you will:

- Understand how to use GPG for encryption
- Be comfortable with basic Pass commands for password management
- Know how to synchronize passwords between different systems
- Have a secure, cross-platform password management solution
- Be able to extend your setup to additional devices

## Getting Started

The next article in this series will guide you through setting up GPG keys on macOS, which is the foundation of our password management system.
